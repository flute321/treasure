A short written passage about your project(max of 100 words each). They can also be bullet points.:
-  the inspirations for your project
I love bananas and consume them on a regular basis, in different forms: milkshakes, banana bread, banana peanut butter sandwich, pancakes, on its own, and more recently protein smoothies. I knew I wanted to do a project with bananas. Back in the days I was studying for the SATs, I remember there being an article about low genetic diveristy in the bananas and how a single disease can quite literally anihilate bananas. If there was a cost-efficient way to detect disease a banana had, farmer could more easily seek means to treat the problem before it spreads to other banana plants. 

I also wanted to learn how to use machine learning and I figured this project would be a good way to merge all my interests and goals.

-  how your project was built, its features, 
I first found a dataset which contained images of banana leaves of bananas with 3 different diseases. I then learned how to load the date and use ML to classify the banana leaves using a variety of tutorials, and created a neural network. My next goal was to create an app which could display the disease of the banana once someone upload an image of one. I wanted the app to be as simple as possible to make it usable by all.

-  challenges you ran into, 
My neural network was having some issues correctly identifying  pestalotiopsis, often misclassifying it as "healthy". I tried using almost every type of data augmentation to make the neural network as strong as possible and it was still have trouble identifying the disease. So, I ended putting a disclaimer message stating that if the leaf looked unhealthy and was classified as unhealthy, that there would high chances of the disease pestalotiopsis. 

-  future plans for your project 
In the future, I would like to increase the accuracy of the neural network to decrease the number of false negatives and I would also like to add other types of diseases which impact bananas as there more than just 3 diseases. adding a user interface for this project.
